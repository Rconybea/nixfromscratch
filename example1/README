a. ingredients
    example1
    +- README       this file
    +- default.nix  nix expression for this package
    +- builder.sh   build script

b. outputs
    example1
    +- result --symlink--> /nix/store/rbngvyn2jmfxqyfny47k5nj8i0yay4hh-example1
    
    /nix/store
    +- m5pqal04a4b0amzs7cy7ka81pr3cggkf-example1.drv
    +- rbngvyn2jmfxqyfny47k5nj8i0yay4hh-example1

1. to enter bash shell for this example
    $ cd ~/proj/nix/example1
    $ nix-shell
   shell environment will be the same as the environment
   that would be used to build the package

2. to build this package
    $ cd ~/proj/nix/example1
    $ nix-build

   expect output like:
     this derivation will be built:
     /nix/store/m5pqal04a4b0amzs7cy7ka81pr3cggkf-example1.drv
     building '/nix/store/m5pqal04a4b0amzs7cy7ka81pr3cggkf-example1.drv'...
     /nix/store/rbngvyn2jmfxqyfny47k5nj8i0yay4hh-example1

   also leaves symlink:
     $ ls -l result
     lrwxr-xr-x  1 roland  staff  52 Mar 25 17:13 result -> /nix/store/rbngvyn2jmfxqyfny47k5nj8i0yay4hh-example1

2a. note that building a package has two steps:
    a. instantiate the derivation;  here that creates the file
        /nix/store/m5pqal04a4b0amzs7cy7ka81pr3cggkf-example1.drv
       with contents like:
        Derive([("out","/nix/store/rbngvyn2jmfxqyfny47k5nj8i0yay4hh-example1","","")], ...)
       Can rehearse just this step with:
        $ cd ~/proj/nix/example1
        $ nix-instantiate
       nix-instantiate does not actually run the builder script.
       It specifically identifies all the dependencies -- I think this means to compute the derivation in default.nix,
       but don't "run it".

    b. realize derivation;  this populates /nix/store/rbngvyn2jmfxqyfny47k5nj8i0yay4hh-example1.
       Can rehearse just this step with
        $ cd ~/proj/nix/example1
	$ nix-store -r /nix/store/m5pqal04a4b0amzs7cy7ka81pr3cggkf-example1.drv

3. to inspect output
    $ cd ~/proj/nix/example1

   let's go through the output.  (note: reordered for clarity)
    $ cat result/hello.env

    NIX_BUILD_CORES=8
    NIX_BUILD_TOP=/private/tmp/nix-build-example1.drv-0
    NIX_STORE=/nix/store
    NIX_LOG_FD=2

   variables beginning with NIX_ generally come from nix configuration

    HOME=/homeless-shelter
    PATH=/path-not-set
   
   HOME, PATH deliberately set to not-to-be-used values.
   We want the output of build to be a function of inputs that are explicitly identified

    PWD=/private/tmp/nix-build-example1.drv-0
    TEMPDIR=/private/tmp/nix-build-example1.drv-0
    TMPDIR=/private/tmp/nix-build-example1.drv-0
    TEMP=/private/tmp/nix-build-example1.drv-0
    TMP=/private/tmp/nix-build-example1.drv-0

   build occurs in a private, temporary directory somewhere.
   /private probably doesn't exist.  Presumably nix does something user-chroot-y

    SHLVL=1
    TERM=xterm-256color
    _=/nix/store/8405gyg05szs83h883v84ds9h6x0i2ir-coreutils-9.0/bin/env
   bash variables, self-explanatory.  including for completeness

    name=example1
    builder=/nix/store/czipazlkvql7n201a9l1jks8kzs0dlqa-bash-5.1-p16/bin/bash
    coreutils=/nix/store/8405gyg05szs83h883v84ds9h6x0i2ir-coreutils-9.0
    system=aarch64-darwin
   each member of derivation { ... } gets passed to builder.sh as its own shell variable

    out=/nix/store/rbngvyn2jmfxqyfny47k5nj8i0yay4hh-example1
   where to put output.  this will be a unique location in the nix store;
   it's still up to builder script to create this
